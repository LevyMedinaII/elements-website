*Using the theme*

(1) Adding a section (category)

  -In your dashboard, go to categories and select 'Add New.' Input the name of the section and slug (optional). Slug equivalents to the url of your section, i.e. buhay-celadon will give you http://localhost/wordpress/categories/buhay-celadon. Next create the page for your section. Go to pages and select 'Add New.' Input the name of the page exactly as the name of the section or category. Select 'category.php' as the template for the page so that the page will function as a section page.
