 		Elements Magazine is the official publication of Ateneo de Manila Universityâ€™s Chinese-Filipino organization, Ateneo Celadon. Launched in A.Y. 2014-2015, Elements Magazine, formerly known as Chinoy, aims to bridge the Chinese-Filipino culture to the greater Filipino society, beginning in the campus through its print medium, published semi-annually, and online through this website. With these, Elements hopes to embody the uniqueness of the Chinese-Filipino culture by enhancing awareness of its relevance and richness present within and beyond the campus.
